How to get or set variables in request in javascript extension policy?
 -- context.getVariable() , context.setVariable().

Key Value Maps wont expire , Cache has expiration.

For NoTarget  , The flow will continue with any post flow policies it wont throw any error.

callbackURL is used in Authorization Grant type

HyperMedia is all about Relations and links.

401 code is to specify UnAuthorized error not Forbidden.

PUT is for create & Update.

OPTIONS is not used for CRUD Operations.

In Basic Authentication username and password are base64 encoded.

Comments has no limitations on length in ThreatProtection policies.

When will we use MessageWeight in SpikeArrest.

To Integrate with third party services we will use ServiceCallout Policy.

AccessControl Policy is for Filtering the incoming requests based on IP.

SOAP Messages are validated through MessageValidation Policy.

Password Grant Type is used for Trusted apps.

Data Masking works in Tracing , wont work for messageLogging.

MessageLogging Policy : In cloud it will log in SystemLog Server.

Hierarchy in BAAS :
-- Organization --> Apps -->  Collections --> Entity

Retrive Assets in BAAS
-- ?type=Asset

We can Push Notifications to Devices,Users,UserGroups.

Pagination Syntax:
-- ?Limit=10&cursor = ABCDEF

Query language syntax
-- ?ql= status='Active'

Proper restAPI URL
-- PUT /Users/{userID}/addresses/{addressID}

Entity relationship can be created using POST and PUT. Syntax for creating entity relationship.
--  firstcollection / Entity / (Relationship) / SecCollection / Entity

Node.js apps on Apigeeedge runs inside Trireme.

Types of healthcheckup. 
-- TCP / HTTP

Default Algorithm for Loadbalancer is RoundRobin.
-- Other Algorthms are Weighted,LeastConnections

We need not zip the node.js app when deployed in Edge and will automatically have the following project structure.

---apiproxy 
     ...
     ..
     Resources
     Node
       api.js

package.JSON is config file in NOde.js apps.

Node.js port will not be used in APIGEE Edge. (when deployed).

Volos has following Modules to support node.js apps.
 -- OAuth , Quota , Cache , Analytics
 
config.JSON has all the environmental details.

<IgnoreUnresolvedVariables> --false will raise a Fault when it finds an unknown variable names.

Response Cache can be used at both request and response end.

HttptargetConnection timeout parameters;
 --- io.timeout.millis , Connection.timeout.millis
 
Fault Rules are executed from Bottom to Top.

If two Target conditions are matching in RouteRules only first target will be executed.

DefaultFaultRule executes only if every Fault Rule fails ( depends on the flow it was placed ).

Swagger2.0 is the recommendation by APIGEE.

Swagger uses YAML specification.

AssignMessage + ExtractVariables + ServiceCallout is best combination for mashup when using external services.

Default Endpoint for OAuth in APIGEE.
-- /accesstoken ,  /Refresh-accesstoken

BAAS Supports ClientCredentials and Password Grant Types only.

which Grant Type doesnot have Refreshtoken
-- ClientCredentials

JSON.Stringify -- to Convert to string from JSON.

Lookout for steps involved in reading soap messages and converting XML to JSON in the process.

Message.Content refers to request or response payload.

Out of box policies are best options for fast processing than extension polcies like javascript , java , regular expression policies.

Success Codes on Target Endpoint-- to catch an error code as success add 4XX or 5XX in Success.Codes.

No: of Entities in BAAS are configurable.

How to retrieve Second Object from JSON
--- $item[1]  ... JSON is zero based.

ConcurrentRatePolicy is used to restrict no of concurrent connections to targetserver.

Prefix Variables are nor visible in Trace utility.(Extract Variables Policy)

Use javascript , java , python for proxy processing at server side.

Best Configuration to reduce the faults , set 
 -- Distirbuted to true and synchronous to true 
 
For performance set synchronous to false.

In Quota , SpikeArrest and other traffic related policies COUNT is configured in which policy.

Few questions around modifying where will you modify TargetURL.

Where is SSO Configured?
===================================================================
Another set may be some of the above questions are repetitive.

****************************General**************************

1. HTTP Verbs which is not used Trace/Patch

2. swagger #ref, definitions/<definitions>


3. where can you store your credentials

harcode policy
ref
file system
ldap




*************************ProxyEndPoint***************************

4. if no route rule matches what happens - defaultfault rule

5. when no targets are specified- what is it used for mock service

6. protocols used in message 

FTP, HTTP, TCP

7. logging can be configured only postMessageFlow


8. health monitor....TCP(ping), HTTP ( response)

9.load balancing default algo- round robin, weighted, least collections

10.FaultRules
error1, error2,




11.Product, API, Organizations

12. role based access
which feature does restrict a group of api's based on roles:




************************BAAS*********************

13. out of box policies - geolocation, push notifcations, no sql data store
geolocation


14.BAAS properties default- type, UUID, name(optional) unique


15. "name" :"s"
""displayName":"Soumya"


16.v1/s
v1?ql=displayName="soumya"


----------------------------------------

17. v1/product/_/_



18.proxy.matchesSuffix v1/product
v1/product/**


19.resource item- collections bag of items

URI Matches


******************************Security*************************
20. 3 legged oauth authorization  code- steps
21. scopes in oauth

22. Wher can SSO be configured?
23. virtual host
24. target server

25. base64- authorization code can be used only once


26. refresh tokens - access tokens uses


********************Caching *********************
27.cache scope - exclusive , organization,encironment

28.cache size in KB setmax KB  ( if size in KB Limit)

************************Lifecycle Mgmt************************

29.pom.xml  options overridden zero downtime deployment
